ðŸ“Œ SoftUni Information Services. IIS-inspired web server for educational purposes only.

ðŸ“¢ SIS is a combination of a Web Server and a MVC Framework. Ultimately it is designed to mimic Microsoftâ€™s IIS and ASP.NET Core MVC. This is my implementation of it through the C# Web Basics course [@SoftUni](https://github.com/SoftUni)

 Its development cycle is a part of "Web Development Basics" courses at SoftUni where the students learn the underlying technology behind Web servies, Servers, HTTP protocol and the ASP.NET MVC framework. 

Originally created and maintained between courses instances by:
* Ivaylo Jelev ([@DCay](https://github.com/DCay))
* Nikolay Kostov ([@NikolayIT](https://github.com/NikolayIT))
* And students of SoftUni
